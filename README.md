Review paper to appear in insect systematics and diversity


1. Why Morphology  
  a) Oldest DNA sequence data about a million years [ ]  
   i) Oldest horse: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12323
   ii) Oldest plankton: https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/44/8/615-618/188189
  b) Remains the only way to place much extinct diversity [ ]  
    i) For any fossil older than 1.5 million years (which is basically none percent of Earth's history), we don't have DNA
    ii) Preservation conditions are really narrow: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12263.epdf?referrer_access_token=LcQY2XuzQKxH2Z1Mtgm6dNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M4FswnyaB_0SKUU6Yal2bw5dc6Vz96jCwbygz8hhfdrRE6aP_pbNiNqktHWj0MfDOnZb8tpltpalR7ex5WhpkIXxHlXYVhsFKJtcoBOyWAh8hCA69vXk-oP18wnikGX_IhypnJV0Fb4_vMpkUWdQHcYI8kYMEHf3SDpNx0Z0kC3r_QaQKEI0fvoMixJloRm-wl7-EUnNJSLUqWEHaRap12&tracking_referrer=www.nature.com
    iii) DNA has a half-life: http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1748/4724
  c) Enables us to obtain and curate fossils for divergence time estimation and comparative methods [ ]  
    i) Biogeographic events can provide some information about ages: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.7155&rep=rep1&type=pdf
    ii) But most will come from fossils
    iii) Fossils form the only direct observation of past organisms. Therefore, to understand trait and functional morphology, fossils are essential:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01723.x
  
2. How have Morphological specimens typically been treated by fossil workers? 
  a) Parsimony [ ]  Farris: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2412028?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents, Fitch: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2412116, Camin and Sokal https://www.jstor.org/stable/2406441?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents
    i) Equal Weights [ ]  
    ii) Unequal weights [ ]

    iii) Implied weights [ ]  
    https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjx65mn-eXdAhUDLK0KHcIQBOYQFjAEegQIABAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.gwu.edu%2F~clade%2Fbisc%2520207%2Fgoloboff_et_al_2008.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1y3YdagtdXfYqCuqJ0BCxF

  b) Mk [ ]  
    i) Regular [ ]  
    Lewis, proposed model: https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/50/6/913/1628902
    Wright, It's a pretty good model! https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109210#s4
    O'Reilly, shots fired at Wright, but I'm still right http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/4/20160081
    O'Reilly, Oh Wright is really right: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pala.12388
    ii) Discrete Beta [ ]  
    Wright: https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/65/4/602/1753365
  c) Continuous characters [ ] 
    High-throughput morphometrics enables lots of morphological data: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12508
    Can be placed on tree: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/evo.13516 
  d) What really differs in the implication between these methods? This will all be synthetic, not sourced.
    i) Model assumptions [ ]  
    ii) Uncertainty [ ]

    iii) Implementations [ ]  
3. How are fossils treated by non-fossil workers, and how can paleobiology-inspired timetrees improve this  [ ]  
  a) Calibration nodes  [ ]

  I'll fill in some more here about the vagaries of the fossil record.
